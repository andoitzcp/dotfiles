\section{OBJECTIVES}

This are the main skills you should obtain by the end of this subject.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Understand the concept of statistics and introduce it's multiple applications.}
    \item{Understand how to differentiate between two data types, numerical and
        categorical data.}
    \item{Understand the difference between population and sample.}
    \item{Inside the descriptive statistic scope, revise the most important
        central tendency statistics and the measures of dispersion and shape.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Concept and use statistics}

The German scientist Alen Archenwall defined it from the Latin word
\textit{status} which means ``The gathering, processing and utilization of the
data by the State''. The dictionary of the Real Academy of the Language defines
statistics as the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{A set of statistical data.}
    \item{Study of the quantitative data of the population, natural and
        industry resources, of traffic or any manifestation of the human society.}
    \item{Branch of mathematics that utilize large data sets to obtain
            inferences based on probability calculations}
\end{itemize}

The first definition only considers the data collections aspect of some subject
without any meaningful mathematical implication. This kind of definition is
often used int business statistics or in sport player statistics such as
height, won games, score etc.

The second definition, apart from the first definition considerations, takes into account various mathematical techniques that manage to summary, organize, display and certainly study a series of data about some concrete facts. This is what's actually called Descriptive Statistics.

Some mainstream descriptive statistics are the IPC, a country's birth rate, the
unemployment rate... The National Institutes of Statistics maintain the harmony
and homogeneity of this ``official statistics''. At the same time, this kind of
statistics are often used to resume the performance of a Company during a year,
study the operations of and hospital or the performance of a school.

Lastly, the third definition applies to what's commonly named inferential
statistics or mathematical statistics, where the inference terminology means
``to deduce consequences about a population from the results of a sample''. The
main difference respect to the ``Descriptive Statistics'' is that here the
sample data is considered as the whole population.

This means that if we merely use the Descriptive Statistics in the study of a
coin flip or in the grades of an exam, we can only see if we have got more
heads than tails of something like that, without knowing if this differences
are due to the randomness of a data sampling process, a truncated coin or
differences into student level.

Logically, as the total population isn't available, the results of an Inference
always will contain errors, which must be quantified using the probability
calculus techniques. The reason why we use sample data could be economical, due
to the elevated cost of acquiring great amounts of data, or pragmatical, due to
the impossibility of collecting data from each population individual. In
example: When data is collected for quality testing and the test are
destructive test, we can't analyze all the production of the factory.

\section{Attributes and Variables. Types of Variables}

A good starting point for a data analysis is to ask yourself what types of
variables are we using. Are they categorical variables or numerical variables?

Types of Variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Numeric data}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Discrete}
            \item{Continuous}
        \end{itemize}
    \item{Categorical data}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Ordinal}
            \item{Nominal}
            \item{Binary}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Numerical Data}

Also known as  ``quantitative data''. Is data based in numbers which can be
used to calculate the temperature, the dimension or the number of people in a
room. It can be made a distinction between discrete and continuous.

\subsection{Categorical Data}

Also known as ``qualitative data''. If the data can be ordered it is called
ordinal data. If the data has disordered categories, it's called nominal data.
Finally if there is only 2 options it is called binary data.

\begin{example}
    Variable types example:

    \captionof{table}{blablabla}
    \noindent\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
        \toprule
        N. Reclamation & Total time & Reclamation type & Incidence Count & Resolved \\
        \midrule
        NR20190123  & 29.73 & AN    & 3 & YES \\
        NR20190124  & 6.83  & OX    & 2 & NO  \\
        NR20190125  & 6.86  & NU    & 0 & YES \\
        NR20190126  & 6.93  & AN    & 1 & YES \\
        NR20190127  & 19.81 & OX    & 4 & NO  \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \\
    \\
    As we can see in this table we have the following variable types:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Total time: Continuous variable}
        \item{Reclamation type: Nominal variable}
        \item{Incidence Count: Discrete variable}
        \item{Resolved: Binary variable}
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\subsection{Numerical and categorical data differences}

So why it's done this distinction?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Information density. Numerical data contains more information than
        categorical data.}
    \item{Visualization tools. The type of data determines the charts used in
        visualizations.}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
   Suppose you are a surgery department manager. You know that your patients
   with a broken arm must leave the hospital within the first 6 days of
   hospitalization. You want to proof that this is possible and you gather data
   from the patients.

   You obtain the next table.
    
   \begin{center}
        \captionof{table}{Patient registry}
        \noindent\begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        Patient ID & Leaves within 6 days & Days in hospital \\
        \midrule
        1 & YES & 5 \\
        2 & NO  & 10 \\
        3 & YES & 5 \\
        4 & YES & 6 \\
        5 & NO  & 7 \\
        \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
   \end{center}
   For this patients we can gather categorical or numerical data.

   \begin{itemize}
       \item{Column 2: Binary $\rightarrow$ Categorical data.}
       \item{Column 3: Discrete $\rightarrow$ Numerical data.}
   \end{itemize}
   If we register binary data we can't later produce the Discrete data shown in
   the 3 column of the table, but we always can produce binary data from
   discrete data. This is why it's said that numerical data is denser than
   categorical data.
\end{example}

This implies that categorical data imply more observations than numerical data.
As a rule of thumb, for numerical variables we need around 30 observations, in
contrast to  categorical data which requires at least 300 observations.

The second reason to differentiate between categorical an numerical data, is
the tools that are going to be used in the visualization of one or the other.

For numerical data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Histogram}
    \item{Box plot}
\end{itemize}

For categorical data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Pie plot}
    \item{Bar plot}
    \item{Pareto plot}
\end{itemize}

\section{Population vs sample data}

We call the population, the series of elements we are interested in studying.
Each of these elements it's usually called individuals or ``statistical
units''.

We must indicate which characteristics are meaningful for each individual,
establishing how are they measured, so the data collected from multiple people
can be comparable.

This characteristics can be classified between qualitative (words) and
quantitative variables (numbers).

Next the data gathering must be planned. Are we going to study every member of
the population, or are we taking a sample of it instead. In both cases it's
necessary to teach every interviewer and to establish perfectly the process of
data collection.

To analyze a sample is always going to be simpler than analyzing the whole population, but this comes at the cost of possible errors due to the sample collection randomness

To analyze a sample is always going to be simpler than analyzing the whole
population, but this comes at the cost of possible errors due to the sample
collection randomness. Errors that must be monitored by the use of the theory of probability calculus.

\subsection{Statistic estimators}

An estimator it's an statistic that approximates to a parameter $\theta$.

The mean:

\begin{equation}
    \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n(m)} \sum_{i \in m} X_i
\end{equation}

The quasivariance:

\begin{equation}
    S^2 = \frac{1}{n(m) - 1} \sum_{i \in m} (X_i - \bar{X})^2
\end{equation}

Population mean stimator:
\begin{equation}
    \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^2 X_i
\end{equation}

Population variance stimator:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N (X_i - \mu)^2
\end{equation}

\section{Location and dispersion measurements}

One of the main goals of the descriptive statistics is to resume the
information contained in a great data set into a few numeric values to achieve
conclusions or compare data between multiple populations.

\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Exercise 1}

In the year 2005, the mean grade in the schools of the Aragon provinces are the
next:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Mean grades per province of Aragon and number of students}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        Province & Students & Mean grade \\
        \midrule
        Teruel      & 1400  & 5.5 \\
        Huesca      & 1200  & 6.0 \\
        Zaragoza    & 3200  & 6.5 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Which is the mean grade of the students in Aragon.

Solution:

\begin{equation}
    \bar{X}_{Aragon} = \frac{5.5 \cdot 1400 + 6.0 \cdot 1200 + 6.5 \cdot 3200}{1400 + 1200 + 3200}= 6.16
\end{equation}

The mean grade of the Aragon students is 6.16 points.

\subsection{Exercise 2}

The heart rate of some athletes is measured after a hard workout with a heart
rate monitor. The following tables is obtained:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Heart rate frequency table of the monitored athletes}
    \begin{tabular}{lc}
        \toprule
        Heart rate & Frequency \\
        \midrule
        $[65-70)$ & 0 \\
        $[70-75)$ & 3 \\
        $[75-80)$ & 3 \\
        $[80-85)$ & 7 \\
        $[85-90)$ & 10 \\
        $[90-95)$ & 12 \\
        $[95-100)$ & 8 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We need to determine:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{The representative of each class}
    \item{Centrality measurements}
\end{itemize}

Solution:

For the given intervals we suppose that each athlete's heart rate is equally
distributed. So we take each interval's central value to calculate the
statistics.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Calculated mean interval}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        Heart rate & Frequency & Range mean\\
        \midrule
        $[65-70)$ & 0     & 67.5 \\
        $[70-75)$ & 3     & 72.5 \\
        $[75-80)$ & 3     & 77.5 \\
        $[80-85)$ & 7     & 82.5 \\
        $[85-90)$ & 10    & 87.5 \\
        $[90-95)$ & 12    & 92.5 \\
        $[95-100)$ & 8    & 97.5 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Then we can multiply each rate mean by the freq and divide all by the sample
size.

Mean:
\begin{equation}
    \bar{X} =
    \frac{
    0 \cdot 67.5 + 3 \cdot 72.5 + 3 \cdot 77.5 +
    7 \cdot 82.5 + 10 \cdot 87.5 + 12 \cdot 92.5 + 8 \cdot 97.5}
    {0 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 8}
    = 88.20
\end{equation}

To calculate the mediane of a data set, we must consider if the data set size
$N$ is even or odd. In case of a odd size we take $N / 2 +1^{th}$ element of the
list. In case of even size we take the $N / 2^{th}$ and $N / 2 + 1^{th}$
element's mean.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Calculated mean interval}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        Heart rate & Frequency & Accumulated freq. \\
        \midrule
        $[65-70)$ & 0     & 0 \\
        $[70-75)$ & 3     & 3 \\
        $[75-80)$ & 3     & 6 \\
        $[80-85)$ & 7     & 13 \\
        $[85-90)$ & 10    & 23 \\
        $[90-95)$ & 12    & 35 \\
        $[95-100)$ & 8    & 43 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In this case, given our odd sample size, we must take the $43 / 2 + 1 = 22^{th}$ element whic is in the range of $[85-90)$ heart beats per minute.

So the median for this sample is:

$Median =
