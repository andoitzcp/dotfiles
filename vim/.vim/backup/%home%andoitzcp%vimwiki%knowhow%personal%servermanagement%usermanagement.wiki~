- Debian
- Ubuntu

== ARCH LINUX ==

This instructions are taken from archlinux wiki.

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Users_and_groups\#User_management

In other OS as debian this commands should also work, but I didn't test them all yet.


=== Creating a new user ===

the general structure:

`# useradd -m -G` _additional Groups_ `-s login_shell` _username_

The simplest example:

`# useradd -m andoitzcp`

Creating a password for the new user:

`# passwd andoitzcp`

=== Modifying existing users ===

To change a user home directory:

`# usermod -d /my/new/home -m` _username_

To change a user's login name:

`# usemod -l` _newname_ _oldname_

=== Group manamgement ===

Display group membership:

`$ groups` _user_

If _user_ is ommited the current username groups are displayed.

To display additional detail about a user:

`$ id` _user_

To list all groups in the system:

`$ cat /etc/groups`

Create a new group:

`# groupadd` _group_

To add an user to a group:

`# gpasswd -a` _user_ _group_

Alternatively:

`# usermod -aG` _additional-groups_ _username_

Rename existing group:

`# groupmod -n` _new-group_ _old-group_

Delete group:

`# groupdel` _group_
